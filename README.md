## General info
<p>This project served many purposes the most important of them being 
the high level exposure to what it takes to develop a complete full stack 
web aplication from end to end. This particular project however limited 
its tech stack to just vanilla javascript this allowed me to build along despite my 
limited javascript knowledge at the time. APIs were also introduced at this point
and gaining a firm understanding of their ins and outs went a long way towards my 
web development knowhow
